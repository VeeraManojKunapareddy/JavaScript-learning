# Functions in JavaScript

Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript. They allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks. In JavaScript, functions are **first-class citizens**, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

## **1. Function Statement (Function Declaration)**
A **function statement** (or **function declaration**) defines a named function using the `function` keyword. It is hoisted, meaning it can be called before its declaration.

---

## **2. Function Expression**
A **function expression** defines a function as part of an expression. It can be named or anonymous and is not hoisted.

---

## **3. Anonymous Functions**
An **anonymous function** is a function without a name. It is often used as a callback or in function expressions.

---

## **4. Named Function Expression**
A **named function expression** is a function expression with a name. The name is only accessible inside the function, making it useful for recursion and debugging.

## **5. First-Class Functions**
In JavaScript, functions are **first-class citizens**, meaning:
- They can be assigned to variables.
- They can be passed as arguments to other functions.
- They can be returned from other functions.
