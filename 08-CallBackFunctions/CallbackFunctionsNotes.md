# Callback Functions in JavaScript

A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed. Callbacks are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, especially for handling asynchronous operations like reading files, making API calls, or handling events.

## **What is a Callback Function?**
- A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.
- It is invoked (or "called back") inside the outer function to complete some action.

## **Why Use Callback Functions?**
1. **Asynchronous Operations**:
   - Callbacks are commonly used to handle tasks that take time to complete, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file.
2. **Modularity**:
   - Callbacks allow you to separate logic and make your code more reusable.
3. **Event Handling**:
   - Callbacks are used to handle events like button clicks, mouse movements, etc.

## **How Callback Functions Work**
1. A function accepts another function as an argument.
2. The outer function performs some operation.
3. Once the operation is complete, the callback function is executed.

## **Key Points About Callback Functions**
1. **Higher-Order Functions**:
   - A function that accepts another function as an argument is called a **higher-order function**.
2. **Synchronous vs Asynchronous**:
   - Callbacks can be used in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts.
3. **Callback Hell**:
   - Nesting too many callbacks can lead to **callback hell**, making the code hard to read and maintain. This is often solved using **Promises** or **async/await**.

## **Example Use Cases**
1. **Event Listeners**:
   - Callbacks are used to handle user interactions like button clicks.
2. **Timers**:
   - Functions like `setTimeout` and `setInterval` use callbacks to execute code after a delay.
3. **APIs**:
   - Callbacks are used to handle responses from asynchronous API calls.
