# Higher Order Functions and Functional Programming

## Higher Order Functions

Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

### Key Concepts

- **Immutability:** Data does not change after it is created.
- **Pure Functions:** Functions that do not have side effects and return the same output for the same input.
- **First-Class Functions:** Functions are treated as first-class citizens.

## Common Higher Order Functions

- **map**
- **filter**
- **reduce**
